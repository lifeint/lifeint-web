LIFE International is the English-speaking Christian fellowship within [Västerkyrkan](https://www.vasterkyrkan.nu/) in Lund, Sweden.

Lund is a vibrant city of about 100,000 people in southern Sweden. With a world-class university and strong research and business sectors, it attracts students and professionals from around the world. Many come from international backgrounds where English is their primary or everyday language.

## Who We Are

LIFE International exists to share the love of Jesus Christ and to build a community rooted in:

- Worship
- Friendship
- Authentic faith

We are grateful for our close relationship with the Swedish-speaking congregation at [Västerkyrkan](https://www.vasterkyrkan.nu/), and we enjoy serving God together in our local community.

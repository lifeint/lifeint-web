Unlike the priestly Sadducees, they believed the Law required thoughtful interpretation so it could be faithfully applied to changing circumstances. Their interpretive approach shaped the Mishnah and became foundational for later Rabbinic Judaism, allowing Judaism to survive and adapt after the destruction of the Temple in 70 AD.",

What was it about those scenes or people that captured your attention?\nIn this episode, Simon hits a moral rock bottom (a moral sandbar?) when he considers turning in his fellow fishermen – men he drinks and hangs out with – to the Romans. What do you think ultimately stops him from going through with it? Was it calculation and self-interest, or something deeper?\nSimon’s wife, Eden, emerges as one of the most significant figures in this episode. How did you experience her faith and her firm, yet loving, stance toward Simon? If you were in her position, how do you imagine you would respond?\nMatthew continues to change as he tries to make sense of both the predictable and the miraculous. How do you think he views Simon at this point? How does Matthew describe – or struggle to describe – the miracle he witnesses?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCautionSpoiler alert!\n\n\n\n\n\nMatthew is traditionally understood to be the author of the first Gospel in the New Testament. Did you notice who provides him with his writing tools – and, effectively, commissions him to carefully record all that he witnesses?\n\n\n\n\nAfter Matthew warns Simon that he will be arrested in the morning, Simon chooses to go fishing anyway. What do you think drives that decision? Faith, desperation, a last act of defiance – or a quiet hope for something more?\nEarlier, Zebedee tells Simon at the bar that he is on his own in the mess he created. Yet on Simon’s darkest night, Andrew, Zebedee, and his sons all show up to help him. What do you think moved them to act? What does this reveal about their relationship with Simon – and about who they are?\nWhat did you learn in this episode about how Jews like Andrew, Simon, and Zebedee expected the Messiah to appear and act? In light of what you reflected on earlier – especially about Messianic expectations shared by the children – do you think it was easy for people to accept that Jesus might be the Messiah they were waiting for? Why or why not?",

It affirms the oneness of God and is recited daily in morning and evening prayers. Drawn from key Torah passages (Deuteronomy 6:4–9; 11:13–21; Numbers 15:37–41), the Shema calls for wholehearted love and devotion to God. It functions as Judaism’s core confession of faith and is traditionally among the final words spoken at death. During its recitation, worshipers often cover their eyes for the opening line to eliminate distractions and focus fully on God’s unity.",

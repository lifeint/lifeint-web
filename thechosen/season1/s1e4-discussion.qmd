## Scripture {#sec-scripture}

:::{.callout-note}
### [Psalm 51:17 NLT](https://www.bible.com/bible/116/PSA.51.17)
^17^ The sacrifice you desire is a broken spirit. You will not reject a broken and repentant heart, O God.

### [1 Peter 5:6-7](https://www.bible.com/bible/59/1PE.5.6-7)
^6^ Humble yourselves, therefore, under the mighty hand of God so that at the proper time he may exalt you, ^7^ casting all your anxieties on him, because he cares for you.

### [Luke 5:1-11](https://www.bible.com/bible/59/LUK.5.1-11)

^1^ On one occasion, while the crowd was pressing in on him to hear the word of God, he was standing by the lake of Gennesaret, ^2^ and he saw two boats by the lake, but the fishermen had gone out of them and were washing their nets. ^3^ Getting into one of the boats, which was Simon’s, he asked him to put out a little from the land. And he sat down and taught the people from the boat. ^4^ And when he had finished speaking, he said to Simon, “Put out into the deep and let down your nets for a catch.” ^5^ And Simon answered, “Master, we toiled all night and took nothing! But at your word I will let down the nets.” ^6^ And when they had done this, they enclosed a large number of fish, and their nets were breaking. ^7^ They signaled to their partners in the other boat to come and help them. And they came and filled both the boats, so that they began to sink. ^8^ But when Simon Peter saw it, he fell down at Jesus’ knees, saying, “Depart from me, for I am a sinful man, O Lord.” ^9^ For he and all who were with him were astonished at the catch of fish that they had taken, ^10^ and so also were James and John, sons of Zebedee, who were partners with Simon. And Jesus said to Simon, “Do not be afraid; from now on you will be catching men.” ^11^ And when they had brought their boats to land, they left everything and followed him.

## Discussion

1. As you watched this episode, which characters or moments stood out to you the most, and why? What was it about those scenes or people that captured your attention?
2. In this episode, Simon hits a moral *rock bottom* (a *sandbar*?) when he considers turning in his fellow fishermen - men he drinks with and lives alongside - to the Romans. What do you think ultimately stops him from going through with it? Was it calculation and self-interest, or something deeper at work?
3. Simon’s wife, Eden, emerges as one of the most significant figures in this episode. How did you experience her faith and her firm, yet loving, stance toward Simon? If you were in her position, how do you imagine you would respond?
4. Matthew continues to change as he tries to make sense of both the predictable and the miraculous. How do you think he views Simon at this point? How does Matthew describe - or struggle to describe - the miracle he witnesses?

:::{.callout-tip}
### Spoiler alert!
Matthew is traditionally understood to be the author of the first Gospel in the New Testament. Did you notice who provides him with his writing tools - and who commissions him to carefully record all that he witnesses?
:::

5. After Matthew warns Simon that he will be arrested in the morning, Simon chooses to go fishing anyway. What do you think drives that decision? Faith, desperation, a last act of defiance - or a quiet hope for something more?
6. Earlier, Zebedee tells Simon at the bar that he is on his own in the mess he created. Yet on Simon’s darkest night, Andrew, Zebedee, and his sons all show up to help him. What do you think moved them to act? What does this reveal about their relationship with Simon - and about who they are?
7. What did you learn in this episode about how Jews like Andrew, Simon, and Zebedee expected the Messiah to appear and act? In light of what you reflected on earlier - especially about Messianic expectations shared by the children — do you think it was easy for people to accept that Jesus might be the Messiah they were waiting for? Why or why not?

## Reflection

1. In Simon’s recitation, he seems to suggest that God has repeatedly let His people down. He lists painful events and places much of the blame on God—but his retelling leaves important things out. What is missing from Simon’s version of the story? In what ways are you tempted to a similar kind of selective remembering - blaming God while overlooking your own role or responsibility?  
2. Which area of your life do you find hardest to release control over — relationships, work, or future plans? What do you think makes that area especially difficult to trust God with?
3. Simon first tells Jesus, “Depart from me,” and then immediately agrees to follow Him wherever He goes. What do you think is happening inside Simon in that moment? Have you ever felt a similar tension between reverence and trust?

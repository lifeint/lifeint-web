To avoid “taking the Lord’s name in vain,” Jews developed the practice of saying Adonai rather than pronouncing the sacred name. In many Bible translations, you’ll notice that LORD appears in all capital letters in the Old Testament. This signals that the original Hebrew word is Yahweh.",

What was it about those scenes or people that captured your attention?\nMary Magdalene and Nicodemus seem to stand at opposite ends of the spiritual spectrum: one feeling broken and unworthy, the other dignified and secure in his religious standing. Which one do you find easier to relate to? If you could speak to each of them, what would you say?\nNicodemus is knowledgeable, respected, and powerful, yet utterly helpless in the face of Mary Magdalene’s suffering. What stood out to you about his reaction in that scene?\nIn his moment of reflection Nicodemus tells his wife, Zohara:\n\n\n“Sometimes I wonder if what we can know of Adonai and the Law is just as blurred. What if we’re not seeing the whole picture? What if it’s more beautiful and — and more strange — than we can ever imagine?”\n\n        How did you understand this? What do you think Nicodemus is struggling to put into words here?\n\nIn this episode, Jesus appears at a very specific moment. How did the timing of His entrance strike you? What do you think the filmmakers are suggesting about His awareness, purpose, and intentionality?\nSome characters in this episode appear trapped by their circumstances. How do you see them responding to that sense of being stuck? Why do you think asking for help might be difficult for them?\nWhat does “calling by name” mean to you?",

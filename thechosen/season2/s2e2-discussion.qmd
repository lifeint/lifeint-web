## :handshake: Discussion {#sec-discussion}
1. As you watched this episode, which characters or moments stood out to you the most, and why? What was it about those scenes or people that captured your attention?
2. Matthew feels out of place among disciples. He has hard time to explain how he feels, but he connects with Philip and Thaddeus. Why do you think is that?

But no, not to you.”\n\n\n“What else will you build?”\n“Wealthy people love decorations and toys for their children.”\n“My family isn’t wealthy.”\n“Many times, that’s better.”\n“I don’t know about that.”\n“You will.”\n\n\n“The Lord loves justice. But maybe it is not ours to handle.” – Jesus\n\n\n“Many times, adults need the faith of children. And if you hold on to this faith really tightly, someday soon you will understand all of what I am saying to you.” – Jesus\n\n\n“I hope my next students ask the same questions you do. […] I hope when the time comes they will tell others about me like you have.” – Jesus\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nThe Shema (or Shema Yisrael) is the central declaration of Jewish faith. It affirms the oneness of God and is recited daily in morning and evening prayers. Drawn from key Torah passages (Deuteronomy 6:4–9; 11:13–21; Numbers 15:37–41), the Shema calls for wholehearted love and devotion to God. It functions as Judaism’s core confession of faith and is traditionally among the final words spoken at death. During its recitation, worshipers often cover their eyes for the opening line to eliminate distractions and focus fully on God’s unity.",

What does this dedication to the children say about about Jesus’ character?\nJesus said that adults, although they have lived longer and know more, need the faith of children. Why do you think He said this? What does the faith of a child look like?\nIn the conversation about justice, Jesus calls the children to be different from those around them; He calls them to be peacemakers. How can we deal with vengeful feelings?\nWe saw Jesus praying often in this episode, sometimes with a lot of passion and emotion. What do you make of this depiction of Jesus praying?\nJesus’ emotional prayers are contrasting with His playfulness in the presence of the children. How do you think His effort to be relatable and approachable affected the perception the children had of Him and His teachings?\nThis episode highlights Jesus’ ordinary, human activities — making a fire, cooking, working, eating, sleeping, even dealing with accidents. What are the filmmakers trying to communicate about how Jesus understood and used His divine power?",

To avoid “taking the Lord’s name in vain,” Jews developed the practice of saying Adonai rather than pronouncing the sacred name. In many Bible translations, you’ll notice that LORD appears in all capital letters in the Old Testament. This signals that the original Hebrew word is Yahweh.",
